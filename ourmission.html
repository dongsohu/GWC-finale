        <p id="miss">Who we are</p>
        <p class='words3'>We are Girls who Code. Girls Who Code was founded with a single mission:</p>
        <p class='words3'>to close the gender gap in technology</p>
        <p class='words3'>Why It Matters:</p>
        <p class='words3'>Computing is where the jobs are — and where they will be in the future, 
        but fewer than 1 in 5 computer science graduates are women.</p>
        <p class="words3">In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. 
        Today, it's only 24%. If we do nothing, in ten years the number of women in computing will decrease to just 22%.</p>
        <p class="alum">Our Alumni</p>
        <p class='words3'>Our alumni are entering college and declaring majors in large numbers for the first time in our six-year history.
        We have approximately 5,000 college-aged alumni. Our alumni who have already declared their majors are choosing to major in CS, or related fields, at a rate 15 times the national average. Our outreach to historically underrepresented groups – particularly girls who are Black, Latino, or from low-income households – is paying off, too. Our Black and Latina alumni are choosing to major in CS or related fields at a rate 16 times the national average.</p>
        <p class='alum'>Our Group</p>
        <p class="groupie" id="grad">In the Girls Who Code summer immersion program in the summer of 2018. 
        We were placed at the company called IAC. It consists of 4 girls:</p>
        <p class="groupie" id="grad2">Ashley Linares, Danielle OngSoHu, Malak Elhebil, Rebecca Epstein</p>
        <p id="miss2" class="groupie">Our Mission</p>
        <p class="groupie">Our mission is to help students maintain or increase thier grades. 
        The title of this project is OnARoll. It is a play on words originating from the words: Honor Roll.
        At some point everyone wants to have high grades, be it during intermediate school, high school, or even college.</p>
        <p class="groupie">The problem that we saw was the struggle to manage time. Students would become very stressed due to rushing what was needed to be given in. 
        Students, contrary to popular belief do not revolve around school and school work. 
        They have lives out of school as some work, take care of their siblings, and many other things.</p>
        <p class="groupie">With our project we will be able to help alleviate the stress of managing time for students in andout of school. 
        For instance the project will help prioritize homeworks and projects for different classes. 
        It will also help with prioritizing homeworks and projects based on the time it is due.
        It will also remember the students' student ID so the student will never have to forgo lunch or checking out books. </p>
